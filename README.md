## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Animate.css
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- jquery

### What I learned

I really was into vanilla CSS, so this was my first time using Sass in a full project.
My codes really got shorter and my code became more consistent.
I'm rally excited to use this in my future projects


### Continued development

My file structure is something i know i have to work on in any projects i'll work on in the future.
I'll also like the time it took me to write the JavaSript code to become shorter in future.
What i still want to improve on in this site is the bac
